If you find something that is not listed above, or that you believe that is an issue, please, open a ticket on the repository.

### Spells
Magic on the game has more things than mentioned before. To handle some of that things, we implemented two new item types: `spell components` and `despots`.

#### Changes on the Character sheet
Because of the requirements for spell, GMs will have two extra informations on the character sheet: Magic Knowledge and Despot.

When you select the Magic Knowledge `Level 1`, it will start to show the spell suit and the suit effect to the player.

When you select the Magic Knowledge `Level 2`, the player will start to see the `Spell Componenets` (see below) as what they are: Spell Components (and not `"Strange" item`, as they see when they don't have this knowledge). However, having the knowledge about spell component does not automatically tells them what that does (or, in game mechanics, what card is associated with it). To give the player access to that information, edit the spell component in their character sheet, and you will see a new checkbox "Show Card Info". That will give them this access.

When you select the Magic Knowledge `Level 3`, they will start to see the despot associated to them, if they have one.

#### Spell Component
When you create a spell component, it has a card associated. When you add that item to the player, it will appear as `"Strange" item` until they get Magic Knowledge `Level 2`. However, you still need to give them access to the Card info.

When they cast a spell, if they have some spell component in their inventory, it will present a pop-up with the list of spell components, allowing them to select one of that. Remember: the spell component is sacrified during the usage, which means that we delete the item from their inventory automatically.

#### Despot
Despots are related to one of the faced cards of the deck.

A character can have only one despot associated to them.

When casting a spell, if the character has a despot associated, it will present the pop asking if they want to use the despot card.

Both Despot cards and Spell Component cards doesn't come from the deck. This means that a character is still able to cast a spell successfully if they have a despot and a spell component with a card that has a value greater or equal seven, even if the deck is empty (magic resources depleted for the day).
